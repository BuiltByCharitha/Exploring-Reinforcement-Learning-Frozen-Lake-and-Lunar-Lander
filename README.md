# Exploring-Reinforcement-Learning-Frozen-Lake-and-Lunar-Lander
This project explores key reinforcement learning (RL) concepts using Gymnasium environments and PyTorch implementations. It consists of two main parts: value-based Q-learning experiments on the Frozen Lake environment and a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) implementation to solve the Lunar Lander v2 environment.
